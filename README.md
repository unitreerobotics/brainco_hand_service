# BrainCo Hand Service

The G1 can be equipped with BrainCo's [2nd generation Dexterous Hand](https://www.brainco.cn/#/product/revo2), which features 6 degrees of freedom.

The dexterous hand is controlled via serial communication, and the manufacturer provides C and Python [SDKs](https://www.brainco-hz.com/docs/revolimb-hand/revo2/parameters.html).

In this repository, we convert serial messages into DDS messages so they can be used with unitree_sdk2.

- Each hand (left or right) is controlled by a USB-to-serial device, and each generates a pair of topics: `rt/brainco/(left or right)/(cmd or state)`.

- The position and speed of the fingers are normalized to the [0, 1] range.

- It is recommended to set the speed of all fingers to 1.0.

- The finger indices are mapped as follows: [Thumb, Thumb_aux, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky].
